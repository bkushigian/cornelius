# Loop Test Subjects

There are three java files here
1. Loops.java
2. ForLoops.java
3. WhileLoops.java

`Loops.java` is compilable, while the other two files may include code that
doesn't compile but is used to test Cornelius serialization in simple ways. For
instance, including `while (false)` will cause a compilation error, but is used
as a base case for testing Theta nodes.

Loops contains similar contents as the other two files with annotations removed.
